# v6502r
visual6502 remixed

Absolutely not sure yet whether this will ever go anywhere, but the idea is:

Take the [visual6502](https://github.com/trebonian/visual6502) project and turn it into a native+wasm app via
[perfect6502](https://github.com/mist64/perfect6502),
[Dear ImGui](https://github.com/mist64/perfect6502)
and [Sokol](https://github.com/floooh/sokol).

Crazy, I know :)
